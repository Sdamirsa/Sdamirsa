Hi there ðŸ‘‹ This is Amir (Seyed Amir Ahmad Safavi-Naini, ðŸ‘¯ I would challenge you for the longest name ever), and I am doing my postdoc on developing âœ¨ AI/ML/DL/NN (or any other fancy abbreviation) solutions in gastroenterology practice at Research Institute for Gastroenterology and Liver Diseases. I coded in Python and R to do some whimsy works and finally get them published somewhere (isn't that the ultimate goal of a researcher?). I believe in open science, and I will not bury my data with me, I promise. I am interested in developing and deploying cross-modality models in clinicians' daily practice.
